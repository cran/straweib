Description: The main function is icweib(), which fits a stratified Weibull
    proportional hazards model for left censored, right censored, interval censored,
    and non-censored survival data. We parameterize the Weibull regression model
    so that it allows a stratum-specific baseline hazard function, but where the
    effects of other covariates are assumed to be constant across strata.
